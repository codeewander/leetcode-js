## Problem

Given an array **nums** and a value **val**, remove all instances of that value **in-place** and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array in-place** with O(1) extra memory.

The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4.
Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

## Constraints:
- 0 <= nums.length <= 100
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 50
- 0 <= val <= 100

## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} val
 * @return {number}
 */
var removeElement = function(nums, val) {
    let p1 = 0
    for(let p2=0; p2<nums.length;p2++){
        if(nums[p2] !== val){
            nums[p1] = nums[p2]  
            p1++  
        }
    }
    return p1
};
```

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(1).
