## Problem

Given a sorted array **nums**, remove the duplicates **in-place** such that each element appear only **once** and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array in-place** with O(1) extra memory.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```


## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var removeDuplicates = function(nums) {
    let p1 = 0
    let p2 = 1 
    while(p2 < nums.length){
        if(nums[p1] === nums[p2]){
            p2++
        }else{
            p1++
            nums[p1] = nums[p2]
        }
    }
    return p1 +1
};
```

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(1).
